  <h1><u>PALAKKAD</u></h1>
  <p >Palakkad, or Palghat, is a city in Kerala, a state in southwestern India. The 18th-century Palakkad Fort has sturdy battlements, a moat and a Hanuman temple on its grounds. North, on the Kalpathy River, the 15th-century Viswanatha Swamy Temple is the main venue of the famous Ratholsavam chariot festival. Northeast, near Malampuzha Dam, the town of Malampuzha has a rock garden created from recycled materials
    Palakkad, the largest producer of rice is known as the granary of Kerala. As many as eight rivers originate from the Palakkad hills. Among the rivers include Bharathapuzha, the longest river in the state. The hilly district has 136257 hectares of reserve forest including Silent Valley .
    In earlier times, Palakkad was also known as Palakkattussery. Many concluded that Palakkad is derived from 'Pala', an indigenous tree which once densely occupied the land; and hence Palakkad or "the forest of Pala trees".
