      <h1><u>PATHANAMTHITTA</u></h1>
        <p >Pathanamthitta district is known as the Headquarters of Pilgrimage Tourism, of the Kerala State. Situated near the Western Ghats and bordered by the hills, Pathanamthitta district is a treat to eyes with its vast unending stretches of forests, rivers and rural landscapes.Pathanamthitta District is a district in the southern part of Kerala, India. The district headquarters is in the town of Pathanamthitta. There are four municipalities in Pathanamthitta: Tiruvalla, Adoor, Pathanamthitta and Pandalam.
            Pathanamthitta is a combination of two words – Pathanam and Thitta – which mean an array of houses on the river side. It is presumed that the regions presently under the District were formerly under the Pandalam reign which had connections with the Pandya Kingdom.
